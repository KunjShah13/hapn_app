Greater efforts are needed to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, and invest more in health, education, social protection, and decent jobs - especially for young people, migrants and refugees and other vulnerable communities. Within countries, it is important to empower and promote inclusive social and economic growth. We can ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of income if we eliminate discriminatory laws, policies, and practices. Among countries, we need to ensure that developing countries are better represented in decision-making on global issues so that solutions can be more effective, credible, and accountable. Governments and other stakeholders can also promote safe, regular, and responsible migration, including through planned and well-managed policies for the millions of people who have left their homes seeking better lives due to war, discrimination, poverty, lack of opportunity, and other drivers of migration.',
